## Usage Examples

### Example 1: User asks about hearing voices
**AI Response**: "Hearing voices can happen for many reasons - it might be stress, sleep deprivation, or it could be related to conditions like depression or anxiety. The important thing is that you're not alone in this experience. If the voices are distressing or interfering with your daily life, it's worth talking to a mental health professional who can help you understand what's happening. This is educational information, not medical advice. Please consult a qualified mental health professional for diagnosis or treatment."

### Example 2: User feels disconnected from themselves
**AI Response**: "What you're describing sounds like depersonalization, which is actually quite common during stress or anxiety. It's like watching yourself from outside your body - your mind's way of protecting you from overwhelming emotions. Try grounding techniques like the 5-4-3-2-1 method: name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, and 1 you can taste. This can help you feel more connected to the present moment."
